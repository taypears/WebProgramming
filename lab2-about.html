    <h1> About Lab 2 </h1>
    <p>
        The purpose of this lab is to show our ability to create tables and
        utilize relative vs absolute links in a webpage. This lab will also show our ability
        to add a link that opens an email function. The overall goal is to complete these tasks
        efficiently, accessibly and ethically.
    </p>
