Compile time errors are things that are illegal in the language, causing the compiler to not understand what instruction to write. 
For example, referencing a symbol that doesn't exist. Syntax errors that the compiler can't understand. They result in the application 
never being built into a runnable product. For these, you will really need to study the language syntax to identify them.

Runtime errors are any errors that are produced when the compiled application is running. 
So, basically, if they are an error, but not a compile time error, then they are a runtime error.

  There's kind of a middle ground too that I wouldn't expect them to be quizzing you on since it's typically compiler or even IDE 
  specific, but that is stuff like static analysis tools that can be plugged into the compilation step and produce a compile time 
  like error that prevents the application from building. Typically these look for code smells or other developer pitfalls, or 
  enforce organization/team rulesets. I think it would be a bit unfair for them to quiz you on this type of stuff though.
